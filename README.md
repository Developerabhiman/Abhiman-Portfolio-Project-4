## Introduction

### Project Overview
The project focuses on automating the process of data extraction from the CoinMarketCap API. The API provides real-time data on cryptocurrency prices, market capitalizations, and more. This project fetches the latest listings of cryptocurrencies, normalizes the data into a structured format, and appends a timestamp for each data entry. The result is a Pandas DataFrame that can be used for further analysis, visualization, or storage in a database.

### Motivation
With the growing importance of cryptocurrencies in the financial markets, having real-time data is crucial for making informed decisions. This project serves as a foundational tool for anyone interested in developing applications related to cryptocurrency tracking, analysis, or trading.

## Portfolio Project

### Use Cases
This project can be showcased as part of a data science or software engineering portfolio to demonstrate skills in:
- API integration and data extraction
- Data manipulation and transformation using Pandas
- Automation of data pipelines

### Real-World Applications
- **Cryptocurrency Trading Bots**: Use the extracted data to feed into trading algorithms for automated buying and selling decisions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following software installed:
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd repository-name
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Obtain a CoinMarketCap API Key**:
   - Sign up for an API key at [CoinMarketCap API](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/).
   - Replace `'your_api_key_here'` in the code with your actual API key.

## Usage/Examples

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Import Necessary Libraries**:
   The project uses `requests` for API calls and `pandas` for data handling.
   ```python
   from requests import Session
   import json
   import pandas as pd
   ```
2. **Set Up the API Request**:
   Define the API endpoint, parameters, and headers.

    ```python
    url = 'https://pro-api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/cryptocurrency/listings/latest'
    parameters = {
    'start': '1',
    'limit': '15',
    'convert': 'USD'
    }
    headers = {
    'Accepts': 'application/json',
    'X-CMC_PRO_API_KEY': 'your_api_key_here',
    }
   ```

3. **Make the API Request and Handle the Response**:
   The data is retrieved and parsed into a JSON format.

   ```python
   session = Session()
   session.headers.update(headers)
   response = session.get(url, params=parameters)
   data = json.loads(response.text)
   ```
4. **Normalize the Data into a DataFrame**:
   The JSON response is converted into a structured DataFrame, with an additional timestamp column.

    ```python
    df = pd.json_normalize(data['data'])
    df['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime('now')
    ```

5. **Analyze or Store the Data**:
   Use the DataFrame for further analysis or store it in a database for future use.

    **Example Output**
     ```python
             id    name     symbol  ...       total_supply    timestamp
        0    1   Bitcoin     BTC    ...     21000000.000000   2024-08-16 10:00:00
        1   52   Ethereum    ETH    ...     120000000.000000  2024-08-16 10:00:00
      ```


      ## Features
   
      **Key Functionalities**
   
      - Automated Data Retrieval: Fetch the latest cryptocurrency data with a single API call.
      - Data Normalization: Transform raw JSON data into a structured and easily analyzable format.
      - Timestamping: Add a timestamp to track when the data was extracted, useful for time-series analysis.

      **Extensibility**

      The project can be extended to:

      - Include additional API endpoints, such as historical data or specific cryptocurrency details.
      - Integrate with databases for storing the data over time.
      - Develop real-time dashboards using libraries like plotly or matplotlib.

    ## Dependencies
   
      **Python Libraries**
   
      - requests: A simple HTTP library for Python, used for making API requests.
      - pandas: A powerful data manipulation library, essential for handling and analyzing structured data.

    ## Installation

      ensure that all dependencies are installed via pip:
   
     ```bash
       pip install requests pandas
     ```

    ## Configuration
   
   **API Key Management**
     - Store your API key securely, and avoid hardcoding it directly in the source code. Consider using environment variables or configuration files to manage sensitive information.

   **Customizing Parameters**
     - The API request parameters, such as the number of cryptocurrencies to retrieve (limit) and the currency for conversion (convert), can be customized based on your needs.


    ## Examples
   
    **Advanced Usage Scenarios**
      -  Historical Data Analysis: Modify the code to retrieve and analyze historical cryptocurrency data, allowing you to identify trends over time.
      -  Real-Time Monitoring: Set up a scheduled job to run the API extraction at regular intervals, storing the data for real-time monitoring or alerts.
  
    **Code Snippets**
   
     ```python  
      # Fetching historical data for a specific cryptocurrency
        def fetch_historical_data(crypto_id, start_date, end_date):
        url = f'https://pro-api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/cryptocurrency/quotes/historical?id={crypto_id}&start={start_date}&end={end_date}'
        response = session.get(url, params=parameters)
        return pd.json_normalize(json.loads(response.text)['data'])

     # Example call
       historical_df = fetch_historical_data(1, '2024-01-01', '2024-08-16')
      ```

   ## Troubleshooting

   **Common Issues**
   
      API Connection Errors: Double-check the API key and ensure your internet connection is stable. Consider adding error handling for retries.
      Data Parsing Errors: Validate the structure of the JSON response from the API. The API might change over time, which could require updates to the code.
   
   **Debugging Tips**

     Logging: Add logging to capture API responses and errors, which will help in debugging issues.
     Interactive Debugging: Use Jupyter notebooks or Python's built-in debugging tools (pdb) to step through the code and inspect variables.
